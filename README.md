# Devlopment Environment

This repo acts as a note for me to quickly set up my Development Environment and tools

Due to the differences of OS Command Line interface, Text editors and lots of stuff, So I separated my settings into Mac and PC.

Here is the links to mac and pc settings
- [Mac](mac.md)
- [PC](pc.md)
